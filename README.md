# Weather-Dashboard
As developers we will be required to access data from another applications API and put it to our own use. Third-party API's allow us to access information in that API by making requests to their URL given certain constraints. We were tasked this homework with creating a weather dashboard that will fetch weather data for a user supplied city, save it to local storage so it could be used easier next visit.

## User Story
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Criteria
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## My Experience
```
I had a lot of fun coding this application. As I get more comfortable with Javascript I am able to branch out and try new things.
I thouroughly enjoyed learning about and using API's. I did have a little trouble with the buttons and getting them to function.
They still do not function until the page is reloaded, and I can't figure that out. All in all, I had fun!
