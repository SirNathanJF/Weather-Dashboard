# Weather-Dashboard
As developers we will be required to access data from another applications API and put it to our own use. Third-party API's allow us to access information in that API by making requests to their URL given certain constraints. We were tasked this homework with creating a weather dashboard that will fetch weather data for a user supplied city, save it to local storage so it could be used easier next visit.
